- Follows the same pattern as LoveJournalApp.jsx
- Environment-based configuration using upload preset
- Automatic metadata tagging with memory content and date

✅ **CreateMemory Integration**

## Setup Instructions:

1. **Cloudinary Setup**: 
   - Create an unsigned upload preset named `love_journal_upload` in your Cloudinary console
   - Enable context metadata in the upload preset settings
   - Update the `CLOUD_NAME` in CreateMemory.tsx if different from 'dhelefhv1'

2. **Dependencies**: 
   - `axios` for API calls (already installed)
   - `lucide-react` for icons (already installed)

## How to Use:

1. **Navigate to Create Memory**: Click on the CreateMemory component
2. **Enter Memory Details**: Write your memory text and select date
3. **Add Image (Optional)**:
   - Option 1: Enter an external image URL
   - Option 2: Upload a local file (will be uploaded to Cloudinary automatically)
4. **Preview**: See image preview before saving
5. **Save Memory**: Click save to upload image (if any) and save memory

## Features:

- **Metadata Tagging**: Images tagged with memory content, date, and alt text
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of upload failures
- **Image Preview**: Visual feedback before saving
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop

## Technical Details:

- **Upload Method**: Uses Cloudinary's unsigned upload API
- **Metadata Format**: `caption=${memoryText}|alt=${memoryText}|dateselected=${selectedDate}`
- **File Types**: Supports all image formats
- **Upload Preset**: `love_journal_upload` (must be configured in Cloudinary)

## File Structure:

```
src/
├── CreateMemory.tsx (main integration with uploadToCloudinaryWithMeta)
├── styles/
│   └── CreateMemory.css (updated styles)
└── api/
    ├── cloudinaryGalleryApi.ts (legacy API - not used)
    └── index.ts (updated exports)
```

The integration now follows the same simple and effective pattern as LoveJournalApp.jsx while providing a clean user experience for the Love Journal app.
